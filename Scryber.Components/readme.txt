Scryber is an advanced PDF generation tool that allows
complete definition of a dynamic PDF document based
on HTML, code, cascading stylesheets,
databinding and templates in referenced files.

This framework is built entirely in .NETCore 6 and is
open source under the LGPL licence so you can link to
it in commercial applications.
